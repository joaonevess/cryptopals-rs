# Cryptopals Solutions in Rust

This project contains solutions to the challenges from [cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com/) implemented in the Rust programming language.

I'm learning Rust and thought it would be fun to try out some cryptography problems to see how well I know the language. I also wanted to share my solutions in case anyone else is interested in learning Rust or cryptography too.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the tests:
```
git clone https://github.com/joaonevess/cryptopals-rs
cd cryptopals-rs
cargo test
```
This will run all of the tests, which will verify that the solutions are correct.
